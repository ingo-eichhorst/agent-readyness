### Decisions

All decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

**v0.0.3 decisions:**
- Full migration to Claude CLI (remove Anthropic SDK entirely, accept higher C4 costs for simplicity)
- shields.io URL output for badges (no local SVG generation in v0.0.3)
- CSS-only expandable HTML sections (no JavaScript)
- Proceed with analyzer reorganization into subdirectories

### Pending Todos
