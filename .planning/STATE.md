## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 5-phase structure following Foundation -> Analysis -> Scoring -> Output -> Hardening dependency chain
- [Roadmap]: Use go/packages from day one for type-aware parsing (research pitfall #1)
- [Roadmap]: Edge cases and performance optimization deferred to Phase 5 (requires full tool first)
- [01-01]: Cobra CLI with root + scan subcommand pattern
- [01-01]: Shared types in pkg/types for cross-package use
- [01-01]: Version set via ldflags (default 'dev')
- [01-01]: Go project detection: go.mod first, fallback to .go file scan

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns
