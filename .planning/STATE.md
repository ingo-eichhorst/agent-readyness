## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v0.0.5]: io.Writer debug pattern for zero-cost debug output
- [v0.0.5]: C7DebugSample type captures prompt/response/score data (reusable for trace modals)
- [v0.0.5]: extractC7 returns all 6 C7 metrics (overall_score + 5 MECE) in scoring pipeline

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

None -- clean start for v0.0.6. All v0.0.5 debug infrastructure available for C7 trace rendering.
