# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-04)

**Core value:** Accurate, evidence-based scoring that predicts agent success and identifies specific improvements teams should make before adopting AI coding agents.
**Current focus:** Phase 18 - C1 Code Health citations + quality protocol establishment

## Current Position

Phase: 18 of 24 (C1 Code Health)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-02-04 — Roadmap created for v0.0.4 Metric Research milestone

Progress: [####################] 100% (v1-v0.0.3) | [..........] 0% (v0.0.4)

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity (v1-v0.0.3):**
- Total plans completed: 38
- Phases completed: 17
- Total milestones shipped: 3

**By Milestone:**

| Milestone | Phases | Plans | Days |
|-----------|--------|-------|------|
| v1 | 5 | 16 | 2 |
| v0.0.2 | 7 | 15 | 2 |
| v0.0.3 | 5 | 7 | 2 |

**v0.0.4 (Current):**
- Phases: 7 (18-24)
- Plans: TBD (determined during planning)
- Focus: Content expansion (citations), not code changes

*Updated after each plan completion*

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v0.0.3]: Claude Code CLI for LLM features — unified auth, no API key management
- [v0.0.3]: HTML5 details/summary for expandables — CSS-only, progressive enhancement
- [v0.0.4]: Per-category citation grouping — matches existing HTML report structure

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **C7 citation scarcity:** AI agent code quality research is nascent field; will cite adjacent research (LLM code generation, SWE-bench) and acknowledge gaps explicitly in Phase 24
- **Paywalled sources:** Some research behind paywalls; find open-access versions, provide preprint links, include sufficient metadata for library lookup
