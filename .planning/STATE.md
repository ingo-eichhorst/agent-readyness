# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-04)

**Core value:** Accurate, evidence-based scoring that predicts agent success and identifies specific improvements teams should make before adopting AI coding agents.
**Current focus:** Phase 24 - C7 MECE Metrics Implementation

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [v0.0.3]: Claude Code CLI for LLM features — unified auth, no API key management
- [v0.0.3]: HTML5 details/summary for expandables — CSS-only, progressive enhancement
- [v0.0.4]: Per-category citation grouping — matches existing HTML report structure
- [18-01]: Citation density 2-3 per metric — avoids academic over-citation
- [18-01]: DOI preferred, ArXiv acceptable — standard for AI-era research
- [18-02]: Duplicate entries per category — Parnas/Gamma in both C1 and C3 for self-contained refs
- [18-02]: Chowdhury (2022) for func_length — only empirical threshold despite Java-specific
- [19-01]: Coverage controversy documented — Mockus (positive) vs Inozemtseva (low-moderate)
- [19-01]: Kudrjavets production assertions contextualized for test assertions
- [20-01]: Pierce (2002) as primary type theory foundation for C2 metrics
- [20-01]: Hoare "billion dollar mistake" labeled as practitioner opinion, not research
- [21-01]: Martin (2003) labeled as influential practitioner perspective for ADP/SDP
- [22-01]: Prana et al. (2019) as primary README research source — definitive 4,226-section study
- [22-01]: Changelog research gap acknowledged — Abebe (2016) release notes as proxy
- [22-01]: Diagram AI caveat noted — effectiveness indirect since agents process text
- [23-01]: Tornhill (2015) labeled as practitioner literature synthesizing academic research
- [23-01]: Borg et al. noted as indirect support for temporal metrics (validates code health broadly)
- [23-01]: Commit stability research gap acknowledged — thresholds are practitioner consensus

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- **C7 citation scarcity:** AI agent code quality research is nascent field; will cite adjacent research (LLM code generation, SWE-bench) and acknowledge gaps explicitly in Phase 24
- **Paywalled sources:** Some research behind paywalls; find open-access versions, provide preprint links, include sufficient metadata for library lookup
