## Milestone Definition

**Original Goal (from PROJECT.md):**
Transform ARS from a Go-specific structural analyzer into a comprehensive, multi-language agent-readiness assessment tool with all seven research-backed analysis categories (C1-C7), HTML reports, and configurable scoring.

**Target Features:**
- ✓ Complete all 7 analysis categories (C1-C7) for comprehensive agent-readiness evaluation
- ✓ Multi-language support: Go, Python, TypeScript analyzers with language-specific metrics
- ✓ Headless agent evaluation (C7) using Claude Code for genuine agent-in-the-loop assessment
- ✓ HTML reports with research citations, metric explanations, and visual score presentation
- ✓ Configurable scoring via .arsrc.yml for custom weights and thresholds
- ✓ Deep documentation quality analysis (C4) with content evaluation, not just presence checks
- ✓ Git-based temporal analysis (C5) for code churn, hotspots, and ownership patterns

## End-to-End Flow Verification

**Total E2E Flows:** 11
**Verified:** 11 (100%)
**Broken:** 0

### Critical User Journeys

**1. Multi-language scan flow** ✓ COMPLETE
```
User runs `ars scan` on polyglot repo
→ All languages detected (Go/Python/TypeScript)
→ C1-C6 analyzed per language
→ Composite scores generated
→ Terminal displays all categories
```

**2. HTML report flow** ✓ COMPLETE
```
User runs `ars scan --output-html report.html`
→ All 7 categories analyzed
→ Radar chart generated as inline SVG
→ Research citations included
→ Self-contained HTML produced (27KB, no external deps)
```

**3. C7 agent evaluation flow** ✓ COMPLETE
```
User runs `ars scan --enable-c7`
→ Cost estimated ($0.02-0.05 shown)
→ User confirms
→ Claude CLI invoked with 4 tasks
→ Tasks executed sequentially
→ LLM scores responses (1-10 rubric)
→ C7 metrics in terminal and JSON
```

**4. Config override flow** ✓ COMPLETE
```
User provides .arsrc.yml with custom weights
→ Config loaded and validated
→ Custom weights applied to scoring
→ Composite score recalculated
→ Recommendations use custom thresholds
```

**5. C4 static metrics flow** ✓ COMPLETE
```
User runs `ars scan` (no LLM flag)

## Gaps & Issues

### Critical Gaps

**None identified.**

### Non-Critical Issues

**Minor warning from Phase 6:**
- TreeSitterParser memory leak (not closed after use)
- **Impact:** Parser created once per scan, OS reclaims memory on process exit
- **Severity:** Low (quality issue, not functional blocker)
- **Recommendation:** Add tsParser field to Pipeline struct and defer Close() in future maintenance

**No other issues detected.**

### Tech Debt

**None identified.**

All phases delivered clean implementations with:
- Zero TODO/FIXME markers in production code
- Zero stub patterns or placeholders
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Full documentation in SUMMARY/VERIFICATION files

## Validation Against Original Intent

**Original PROJECT.md Goal:**
> Transform ARS from a Go-specific structural analyzer into a comprehensive, multi-language agent-readiness assessment tool with all seven research-backed analysis categories.

**Achievement:**
- Started: Go-only tool with C1, C3, C6 (3 categories)
- Delivered: Multi-language tool with C1-C7 (7 categories)
- Languages: Go, Python, TypeScript
- Output: Terminal, JSON, HTML
- Flexibility: Configurable weights/thresholds
- Innovation: Genuine agent-in-the-loop evaluation (C7)

**Milestone goal EXCEEDED.** System delivers all planned features plus additional polish (gap closure phases 11-12).

---

## Recommendations

### For Milestone Completion

**✓ Proceed to /gsd:complete-milestone v2**

All requirements satisfied, no critical gaps, no blocking tech debt. Milestone is complete and ready to archive.

### For Future Work (v3 Considerations)

**Minor technical debt to address:**
1. Fix TreeSitterParser memory leak (add explicit Close() in pipeline)
2. Consider adding metrics for parser resource management

**Enhancement opportunities:**
- Incremental scanning with caching (.ars-cache/)
- Markdown report output for PR comments
- GitHub Action integration
- Monorepo per-package scoring

These are v3 scope (per PROJECT.md out-of-scope section).
