# Milestone v0.0.3 Audit Report

**Milestone:** v0.0.3 Simplification & Polish
**Audited:** 2026-02-04T13:15:00Z
**Status:** PASSED

**Coverage:** 15/15 connections verified (100%)

## E2E Flow Verification

| Flow | Steps | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| `ars scan --badge <dir>` | CLI → pipeline → badge.go → terminal | ✓ COMPLETE |
| `ars scan --output-html report.html <dir>` | CLI → pipeline → html.go → descriptions → template | ✓ COMPLETE |
| C4/C7 with Claude CLI | pipeline auto-detect → evaluator → C4/C7 | ✓ COMPLETE |
| Self-analysis with coverage | go test cover.out → C6 detection → score | ✓ COMPLETE |

**Coverage:** 4/4 flows complete (100%)

## Tech Debt

Minor documentation artifacts (non-blocking):

### Phase 15: Claude Code Integration

| Location | Item | Severity |
|----------|------|----------|
| terminal.go:457 | Comment references removed flag --enable-c4-llm | INFO |
| types.go:242 | Comment references removed flag --enable-c4-llm | INFO |

**Impact:** Display text only. Does not affect functionality. Can be cleaned up in future polish pass.

**Total tech debt:** 2 items across 1 phase (all INFO severity)

## Anti-Patterns

No critical anti-patterns found across all phases:
- 0 TODO/FIXME blocking production
- 0 stub implementations
- 0 placeholder content
- 0 orphaned exports
- 0 missing connections

## Test Results

All tests pass:
```
go test ./...
# 100+ tests passing
# Total duration: ~175s
```

Test coverage by area:
- internal/agent: Full coverage of CLI detection and evaluation
- internal/analyzer/*: All 7 category subdirectories tested
- internal/output: badge, HTML, terminal, JSON tested
- internal/pipeline: Full integration tests

## Architectural Improvements

Notable improvements beyond plan:

1. **shared/ subpackage** (Phase 16): Created `internal/analyzer/shared/` to resolve import cycles cleanly. Subdirectories import `shared/`, root imports subdirectories, no circular dependencies.

2. **Auto-detection** (Phase 15): Pipeline automatically detects Claude CLI and enables LLM features without user flags. Cleaner UX than manual --enable-c4-llm.

3. **CSS-only expandables** (Phase 14): HTML report uses native HTML5 details/summary. JavaScript only for bulk operations. Progressive enhancement.

## Conclusion

Milestone v0.0.3 is **COMPLETE** and ready for release.

**Achievements:**
- Unified LLM integration on Claude Code CLI (removed Anthropic SDK)
- Badge generation for README visibility
- Enhanced HTML reports with research-backed metric descriptions
- Clean analyzer organization with 7 category subdirectories
- Standard README badges and coverage improvements

**Quality:**
- 22/22 requirements satisfied
- 5/5 phases verified
- 15/15 integrations working
- 4/4 E2E flows complete
- 2 INFO-level tech debt items (non-blocking)
