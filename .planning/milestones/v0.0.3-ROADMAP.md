# Milestone v0.0.3: Simplification & Polish

**Status:** ✅ SHIPPED 2026-02-04
**Phases:** 13-17
**Total Plans:** 7

## Overview

ARS v0.0.3 simplifies LLM integration by unifying on Claude Code CLI (removing Anthropic SDK), adds badge generation for visibility, enhances HTML reports with research-backed expandable descriptions, reorganizes the analyzer codebase into category subdirectories, and adds polish items (README badges, testing improvements). The milestone follows a risk-ordered approach: low-risk additive features first, then the highest-risk behavior change (Claude Code migration), followed by structural reorganization after features stabilize.

## Phases

### Phase 13: Badge Generation

**Goal**: Users can generate shields.io badge URLs to display ARS scores in READMEs
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of milestone)
**Requirements**: BADGE-01, BADGE-02, BADGE-03
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 13-01-PLAN.md — Badge URL generation, CLI flag, and output integration

**Success Criteria:**
1. Running `ars scan --badge` outputs a shields.io markdown URL to stdout
2. Badge color reflects the tier (red for Agent-Hostile, orange for Agent-Limited, yellow for Agent-Assisted, green for Agent-Ready)
3. Badge displays both tier name and numeric score (e.g., "Agent-Ready 8.2/10")

### Phase 14: HTML Enhancements

**Goal**: HTML reports provide educational context with expandable research-backed metric descriptions
**Depends on**: Nothing (independent of Phase 13)
**Requirements**: HTML-01, HTML-02, HTML-03, HTML-04
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 14-01-PLAN.md — Metric descriptions data, HTML struct updates, template with details/summary

**Success Criteria:**
1. Each metric in HTML report shows a brief 1-2 sentence description
2. Each metric has an expandable section with detailed explanation and research citations
3. Expandable sections work without JavaScript (CSS-only details/summary)
4. Categories scoring below 6.0 have their detail sections expanded by default

### Phase 15: Claude Code Integration

**Goal**: All LLM features use Claude Code CLI, eliminating Anthropic SDK dependency
**Depends on**: Nothing (independent feature work)
**Requirements**: LLM-01, LLM-02, LLM-03, LLM-04, LLM-05
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 15-01-PLAN.md — CLI detection, evaluator infrastructure, C4 refactor to use CLI
- [x] 15-02-PLAN.md — Pipeline auto-detection, flag cleanup, SDK removal

**Success Criteria:**
1. C4 documentation quality analysis uses Claude Code CLI (`claude -p`) instead of Anthropic SDK
2. C7 agent evaluation continues working with Claude Code CLI (regression check)
3. LLM analysis runs automatically when Claude CLI is available (no `--enable-c4-llm` flag)
4. No `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable required
5. Anthropic SDK removed from go.mod

### Phase 16: Analyzer Reorganization

**Goal**: Analyzer code organized into category subdirectories for improved navigability
**Depends on**: Phase 15 (do structural changes after features stabilize)
**Requirements**: REORG-01, REORG-02, REORG-03, REORG-04
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 16-01-PLAN.md — Foundation: create directories, shared.go, root re-exports
- [x] 16-02-PLAN.md — Move all category files, update imports, verify tests

**Success Criteria:**
1. Each category has its own subdirectory (internal/analyzer/c1/, c2/, ..., c7/)
2. All analyzer files moved to appropriate subdirectories
3. All import paths work correctly (no broken imports)
4. Root-level analyzer.go provides re-exports for backward compatibility

### Phase 17: README & Testing

**Goal**: Project has standard status badges and test commands include coverage
**Depends on**: Nothing (independent polish work)
**Requirements**: README-01, README-02, README-03, README-04, TEST-01, TEST-02
**Plans**: 1 plan

Plans:
- [x] 17-01-PLAN.md — Add LICENSE, README badges, fix coverage filename

**Success Criteria:**
1. README displays Go Reference badge
2. README displays Go Report Card badge
3. README displays License badge
4. README displays Release badge
5. Test commands in documentation include `-coverprofile` flag
6. Coverage data is available for C6 self-analysis

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Use Claude Code CLI for all LLM features (rationale: single auth, simpler UX)
- Auto-enable LLM when CLI detected (rationale: zero-config for users with CLI)
- Create shared/ subpackage for analyzer utilities (rationale: resolve import cycles cleanly)
- Use HTML5 details/summary for expandable sections (rationale: CSS-only, progressive enhancement)
- shields.io URL encoding with double-dash for hyphens (rationale: shields.io parsing)

**Issues Resolved:**
- Import cycle in analyzer reorganization (solved with shared/ subpackage)
- SDK removal required updating scorer to use new field names

**Issues Deferred:**
- Comment references to removed --enable-c4-llm flag (INFO-level tech debt)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- 2 INFO-level items: comments in terminal.go:457 and types.go:242 reference removed flag
