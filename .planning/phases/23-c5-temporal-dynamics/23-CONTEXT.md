# Phase 23: C5 Temporal Dynamics - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-04
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Add research-backed citations to all 5 C5 Temporal Dynamics metric descriptions (churn_rate, temporal_coupling_pct, author_fragmentation, commit_stability, hotspot_concentration). Citations follow quality protocols established in Phase 18.

</domain>

<decisions>
## Implementation Decisions

### Citation patterns
- Follow established protocols from C1-C4 (Phases 18-22)
- Use same citation density (2-3 per metric prioritizing seminal works)
- Apply same quality standards (verified URLs, DOI preferred, ArXiv acceptable)
- Match existing format: inline citations in descriptions.go, full references in citations.go

### Source selection
- Tornhill's work as primary temporal analysis source (practitioner perspective, label accordingly)
- D'Ambros et al. for academic temporal coupling research
- Kim et al. (2007) already cited for churn/author fragmentation - verify accessibility
- Find sources for commit_stability if available, acknowledge gap if not
- Include Bird/Nagappan organizational dynamics work if relevant

### Book handling
- Tornhill's "Your Code as a Crime Scene" (2015) treated like Martin (2003) - influential practitioner perspective
- Include ISBN as stable backup to URLs
- Label as practitioner book, not academic research

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact citation allocation across 5 metrics
- Whether to find additional sources beyond Tornhill/D'Ambros/Kim
- How to handle any research gaps for specific metrics
- Priority order for citation work

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Reference completed phases (C1-C4) as templates for consistency
- Current metrics already have Kim (2007) and Tornhill (2015) cited - verify those exist and are accessible
- Phase 18 quality protocols include URL verification, source quality checklist
