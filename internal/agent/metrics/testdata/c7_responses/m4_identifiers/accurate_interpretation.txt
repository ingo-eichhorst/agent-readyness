- Interpretation: Based on the name alone, `NewM2ComprehensionMetric` is almost certainly a constructor function (following Go's `New` prefix convention) that creates and returns an instance of a metric related to "M2 Comprehension." The "M2" suggests it's the second metric in an ordered set (M1, M2, M3, ...), and "Comprehension" indicates it measures some form of understanding or comprehension ability. It likely belongs to a metrics or evaluation domain, possibly measuring how well an AI agent comprehends code. The function probably returns a pointer to a struct that implements a `Metric` interface, initialized with default configuration values like sample counts and timeouts.

- Verification: Reading `internal/agent/metrics/m2_comprehension.go` at line 26, I found:

```go
func NewM2ComprehensionMetric() *M2Comprehension {
    return &M2Comprehension{
        sampleCount: 3,
        timeout:     120 * time.Second,
    }
}
```

This is indeed a constructor function that creates an `M2Comprehension` struct with `sampleCount: 3` and `timeout: 120s`. The `M2Comprehension` type measures "the agent's ability to understand what code does" -- it tests semantic understanding (behavior), not syntactic correctness. It implements the `Metric` interface with methods like `ID()` (returns "code_behavior_comprehension"), `Name()`, `SelectSamples()`, and `Execute()`.

- Accuracy: My interpretation was accurate. I correctly identified it as a Go constructor function that creates a comprehension metric instance. The "M2" ordering, the comprehension measurement purpose, and the interface implementation pattern all matched my prediction. The only detail I couldn't have known from the name alone was the specific default values (3 samples, 120s timeout) and that comprehension specifically means code behavior understanding as opposed to documentation or API comprehension.
